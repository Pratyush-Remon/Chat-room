## Reverse Shell


This is use to connect to a remote computer and access their command line to perform tasks


using Socket and OS.


### Socket:

It connects the IP and the Port together so that remote computers can connect and communicate with each other

IP: Its a unique adress of a computer in most of the computer its dynamic and keeps on changing


So how can we connect to a computer whose IP keeps changing?

Here is where Reverse Shell connection comes into play,what it does is it connect the clients PC to yours PC 

All u need is Select a unique port and stage server_main.py on a cloud server with static ip
